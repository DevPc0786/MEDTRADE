        This journey started in 1990 with a vision “to bring happiness in
        people’s lives by providing healthcare solutions”. It has been our
        motto, our credo, our guiding star since then. We pioneered the concept
        of Custom-Made Medical Compression Garments in India under brand NORMA.
        We pioneered the concept of Back-Care and Seating Solutions in India
        under brand AMRON. And then in 2007, we pioneered the concept of Home
        Healthcare in India under brand MEDIRENT.

        Medirent services has taken a revolutionary and innovative step by
        renting out expensive medical equipment on rent for home use at
        affordable rentals.

      <p className="text-[--graytext] text-sm mb-5">
        Even though medical science can save the patient’s life but proper home
        care leads to a faster recovery. Care giving techniques often require
        hi-tech, expensive medical equipment. While many of these types of
        equipment can help in saving the life of critical patients as it
        happens, therefore most of these types of equipment are expensive and
        are generally needed for a few days or weeks, thus, curbing the need of
        buying them despite of their affordability.{" "}
